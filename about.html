    <p>Our Vision - Our vision at Project Green is to make a greener and more eco-friendly
      world through the use of technology. </p>

    <p>How it works - Project Green is a program that allows for an easy way for users to determine
       if a space is plantable for trees. It scans a satellite image and takes in approximate coordinates
       of the image to determine if the area is ideal for trees and what type of tree it is ideal for the region.</p>
